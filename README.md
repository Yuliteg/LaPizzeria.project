# LaPizzeria.project

This application is a delivery site for a pizzeria.
In this application, you can see the pizzeria menu that I take from the API that I created using the https://mockapi.io/ service. 
After that, you can add the item to your shopping cart and calculate the total cost.
I developed this application from scratch to consolidate the knowledge gained in the John Smilga JavaScript course. HTML5, CSS, JSON, RestApi, JS.
